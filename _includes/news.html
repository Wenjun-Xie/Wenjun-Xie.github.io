<p>We revealed how commercialized covalent inhibitors for kinases achieve selectivity over evolutionarily-related sequences. We reported the result in <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c07307">JACS</a>.</p>

<p><i>Jul 28, 2022</i></p>
<p>We found that natural evolution underlies the laboratory evolution of designer enzymes whose scaffold is obtained from natural proteins. We reported the result in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2207904119">PNAS</a>.</p>

<p><i>May 23, 2022</i></p>
<p>I gave a talk at Enzyme Engineering XXVI on enzyme design.</p>

<p><i>Mar 3, 2022</i></p>
<p>I was awarded the Arthur W. Adamson Postdoctoral Recognition Award from USC.</p>

<p><i>Jan, 2022</i></p>
<p>Two PNAS papers were published with Arieh and Hao.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2122355119">connected enzyme evolution and enzyme catalysis</a>, two important phenomena at contrasting timescales; the connection provides the first-ever systematic method to predict mutation effects on enzyme activity.</p>

<p><i>Oct 8, 2020</i></p>
<p>I joined <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2013/warshel/facts/">Arieh Warshel</a>'s lab at USC.</p>

description: Solutions are essential for life. Their properties at the molecular level can be best studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451929418303723">We combined ab-initio MD simulations, pump-probe spectroscopy, and NMR to learn how TMAO interacts with urea in marine animals.</a> We employed force-field MD simulations to explain the <a href="http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C2FD20065A">salt effects on protein structure</a> and <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1600345">counterion effects on the ice nucleation on polyelectrolytes</a>. These studies prompted us to propose <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/jz402072g">a simple theory for the famous Hofmeister series</a>. In another study, we also demonstrated <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2120287119">how the electrolyte solution affects interleukin release through the GSDMD pore during inflammation</a>.

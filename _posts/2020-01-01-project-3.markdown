description:  <p>Enzymes are remarkable biocatalysts that tremendously accelerate chemical reactions. Our knowledge of enzymes is incomplete, if not poor, despite extensive studies through several generations of scientists. We believe learning from nature is inescapable to advance enzymology further. Recently, we <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2122355119">connected enzyme evolution and enzyme catalysis</a>, two important phenomena at contrasting timescales; the connection provides the first-ever systematic method to predict mutation effects on enzyme activity. The prediction suggests a rational way to engineer enzymes. Besides, we found that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2207904119">natural evolution underlies the laboratory evolution of designer enzymes</a> whose scaffold is obtained from natural proteins. Moreover, we revealed <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c07307">how commercialized covalent inhibitors for kinases achieve selectivity</a> over evolutionarily-related sequences. Each of our studies has many implications and applications. Collaborating with biochemists, we are starting to have experimental results. Fox example, we recently demonstrated the high success rate of our method in enzyme design (manuscript available). Stay tuned!</p>

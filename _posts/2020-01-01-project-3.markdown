description: Enzymes are remarkable biocatalysis that can tremendously accelerate chemical reactions. Our knowledge of enzyme mechanisms is still far from complete despite extensive studies through several generations of scientists. We recently introduced enzyme evolution into enzyme studies and developed the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2122355119">first-ever method to predict mutation effects on enzyme activity systematically</a>. Currently, we are working on several related projects. Stay tuned!

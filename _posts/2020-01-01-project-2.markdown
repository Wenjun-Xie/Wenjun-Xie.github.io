description: Why human has multiple cell types with the same DNA sequence? Because of the epigenome! <a href="https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(19)30306-6">We aim to understand the establishement of epigenetic information using data-driven approaches.</a> Some of our predictions has been recently confirmed in experiment. The epigenome also affects chromatin folding, which plays critical roles in genome function. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008262">Our analysis of single-cell chromatin imaging data unraveled the phase separation mechanism caused by epigenome patterns. Importantly, we are able to quantify the energy landscape of chromatin folding using machine learning and statistical physics.</a>
